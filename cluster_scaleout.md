# How to scale out a DolphinDB cluster

## 1. About DolphinDB Cluster

A DolphinDB cluster consists of 3 types of nodes: controller, agent and data node.
- A controller manages the metadata of a cluster and provides the web cluster management interface. 
  A controller has the following 3 configuration files:
    - controller.cfg: the configuration parameters for the controller node, such as IP address, port number, the maximum number of connections, etc.
    - cluster.nodes: a list of nodes in the cluster. The controller node uses this file to get information of the cluster nodes.
    - cluster.cfg: individual configuration of each node in the cluster, such as parameter 'volumes' of a node.
- An agent is deployed on each physical machine and is responsible for starting and stopping local data nodes. The configuration file on the agent is:
    - agent.cfg: specifies properties relevant to the agent node, such as IP and port, the cluster's controller node, etc.
- Data dodes for computing, querying, and data storing.

Follow the following steps to add a new physical machine to a cluster:
- Deploy an agent node on the new server and configure the file agent.cfg
- Register information about the new agent node and new data nodes with the controller node
- Restart the controller and all data nodes

To expand the storage space of an existing data node, we can modify the node configuration file to add a path to parameter 'volumes'.

## 2. Add Data Nodes

In the example below, we will add a new physical server to a cluster and deploy a data node on it.

The cluster was deployed on the following 4 servers:

```
172.18.0.10 : controller
172.18.0.11 : datanode1
172.18.0.12 : datanode2
172.18.0.13 : datanode3
```

The cluster has the following configuration files:

controller.cfg
```
localSite=172.18.0.10:8990:ctl8990
```

cluster.nodes
```
localSite,mode
172.18.0.11:8701:agent1,agent
172.18.0.12:8701:agent2,agent
172.18.0.13:8701:agent3,agent
172.18.0.11:8801:node1,datanode
172.18.0.12:8802:node2,datanode
172.18.0.13:8803:node3,datanode
```

The command line to start the controller:
```
nohup ./dolphindb -console 0 -mode controller -script dolphindb.dos -config config/controller.cfg -logFile log/controller.log -nodesFile config/cluster.nodes &
```
The command line to start the agent:
```
./dolphindb -mode agent -home data -script dolphindb.dos -config config/agent.cfg -logFile log/agent.log
```

Create a partitioned database in the cluster:
```
data = table(1..1000 as id,rand(`A`B`C,1000) as name)
db = database("dfs://scaleout_test_db",RANGE,cutPoints(1..2000,10))
tb = db.createPartitionedTable(data,`scaleoutTB,`id)
tb.append!(data)
```
We can browse the data in the DFS Explorer of the cluster web interface.

> * For more details about cluster configuration, please refer to [DolphinDB Cluster Deployment on Multiple Servers](https://github.com/dolphindb/Tutorials_EN/blob/master/multi_machine_cluster_deploy.md)

The IP address of the new machine:
```
172.18.0.14
```
The IP address, port number and the unique alias name of the data node in the cluster:
```
172.18.0.14:8804:datanode4
```

### 2.1 Configure the New Agent

Agent node is deployed in the directory `/home/<DolphinDBRoot>`. Copy the files in the directory on any server to the directory `/home/<DolphinDBRoot>` of the new machine, and modify /home/<DolphinDBRoot>/config/agent.cfg as follows:

```
//specify the IP address and port number of the new agent node
localSite=172.18.0.14:8701:agent4

//the controller node information
controllerSite=172.18.0.10:8990:ctl8990

Mode=agent
```

### 2.2 Configure Controller

Modify the file cluster.nodes to include the new agent node and data node:

```
localSite,mode
172.18.0.11:8701:agent1,agent
172.18.0.12:8701:agent2,agent
172.18.0.13:8701:agent3,agent
172.18.0.11:8801:node1,datanode
172.18.0.12:8802:node2,datanode
172.18.0.13:8803:node3,datanode

//new agent node and data node
172.18.0.14:8704:agent4,agent
172.18.0.14:8804:node4,datanode
```

#### 2.3 Restart the cluster

Restart the entire cluster, including the controller node and all data nodes.

- Close all data nodes on the web interface ```http://172.18.0.10:8990```.

- Execute ```pkill dolphindb``` on the server (172.18.0.10) to shut down the controller node.

- After waiting for about half a minute (for the port to be released), restart the controller.

- Back to the web interface, you can see that a new agent node has been added and is started, and all data nodes are started.

By now we have successfully added a new server and a new data node to the cluster.

### 2.4 Verification

Let's verify that the new data node is enabled in the cluster by writing some data to the cluster.
```
Tb = database("dfs://scaleout_test_db").loadTable("scaleoutTB")
Tb.append!(table(1001..1500 as id,rand(`A`B`C,500) as name))
```
In the DFS Explorer, you should see that the data has been populated to the new data node.

## 3. Add Hard Disks to a Data Node

The storage capacity of existing data nodes might become insufficient. The following example explains how to add a hard disk to node3.

The storage paths can be specified with the configuration parameter 'volumes'. The default storage path is `<HomeDir>/<Data Node Alias>/storage`.

> If you add a disk from the default path, you must explicitly set the original default path when specifying the parameter 'volumes'. Otherwise, the metadata will be lost in the default path.

The default value for parameter 'volumes' is as follows. You need to add it to the configuration file if it doesn't exist there.

cluster.cfg
```
node3.volumes=/home/server/data/node3/storage 
```

To add the new disk path /dev/disk2/node3 to node3, just add the path to the line above after a comma.

cluster.cfg
```
node3.volumes=/home/server/data/node3/storage,/dev/disk2/node3
```

After modifying the configuration file, execute `loadClusterNodesConfigs()` on the controller to reload the configuration parameters. If the steps above are completed on the cluster management web interface, configuration parameters are automatically reloaded, and we don't need to execute `loadClusterNodesConfigs()`. After the configuration is completed, there is no need to restart the controller. Just restart node3 on the web interface so that the new configuration can take effect.

> If you would like the new storage to take effect immediately without restarting node3, you can execute `addVolumes("/dev/disk2/node3")` on node3. However, this will not be effective any more after the cluster restarts.

After the configuration is completed, execute the following script to write data to the cluster and check if data is written to the new disk.
```
tb = database("dfs://scaleout_test_db").loadTable("scaleoutTB")
tb.append!(table(1501..2000 as id,rand(`A`B`C,500) as name))
```
Data has been written to the disk:
