# DolphinDB Database Security and User Access Control

DolphinDB provides users with a powerful, flexible and secure access control system. As the access control center, the controller of a cluster adopts RSA to encrypt key information.

Main features of the access control system:
* Can conveniently grant/deny access privileges to groups of users
* 9 types of access privileges for various scenarios
* Various access control functions/commands
* Function views can provide analysis results without sacrificing data privacy
* Access control for scheduled jobs and streaming tasks
* RSA encryption for key information
* Support SSO to simplify cross domain access

## 1. Access Control

### 1.1 Users and Groups

DolphinDB access control system uses groups to manage users with the same access privileges. A user can belong to 0, 1 or multiple groups; a group can have 0, 1 or multiple users.

A user's access privileges are determined by her own access privileges and the privileges of the groups that she belongs to. You can grant or deny the access of a user or a group (See [Section 1.5](#15-rules-about-access-privileges)).

DolphinDB verifies the userâ€™s identity with username and password. `login` and `logout` are used to manage the login/logout functionality. Users can change the login password with `changePWd`. Administrators can use `resetPwd` to modify the login password.

### 1.2 Administrators

There are 2 types of administrators in DolphinDB: super admin and admin.

When a DolphinDB cluster is started for the first time, it creates a super admin with user ID of "admin" and password of "123456". This super admin has all access privileges mentioned in [Section 1.3](#13-access-privilege-types) and cannot be deleted. 

The super admin can create or delete users (including admin) and add them to different groups. By default, newly created users don't have any access privileges. However, administrators can grant/deny/revoke access to users or groups.

Functions or commands that an administrator can use:

* `addGroupMember`: Add a user to a group or multiple groups
* `createUser`: Create a user  
* `deleteUser`: Delete a user  
* `createGroup`: Create a group  
* `deleteGroup`: Delete a group
* `deleteGroupMember`: Remove a user from a group or multiple groups, or remove multiple users from a group  
* `getUserAccess`: Obtain the privileges for users, without taking into account the privileges for the groups the users belong to  
* `getUserList`: Obtain a list of user names other than the administrators  
* `getGroupList`: Obtain a list of group names  
* `resetPwd`: Reset a user's password

For detailed usage of the above commands and functions, please see [DolphinDB help](https://www.dolphindb.com/help/index.html).

The following table summarises the difference among super admin, admin and regular user.

|                                                      |      super admin      |       admin      |       user       |
|:-----------------------------------------------------|:----------------------|:-----------------|:-----------------|

| Can grant or deny privilege for admin/user/group     | Yes                   | Yes              | No               |
| Can create or delete function view                   | Yes                   | Yes              | No               |
| Can delete scheduled jobs submitted by other users   | Yes                   | Yes              | No               |

**Note**: An admin cannot delete the super admin, or grant/deny privileges to the super admin.

### 1.3 Access Privilege Types

DolphinDB supports the following 9 types of access privileges: 

1. **TABLE_READ**: read tables
2. **TABLE_WRITE**: write to tables
3. **DBOBJ_CREATE**: create database objects (tables) in a database
4. **DBOBJ_DELETE**: delete database objects (tables) in a database
5. **VIEW_EXEC**: execute view functions
6. **DB_MANAGE**: create and delete databases 
7. **DB_OWNER**: create databases. For the databases she created, she can delete the databases, create or delete tables, create or delete partitions, grant/deny/revoke the following privileges of other users: **TABLE_READ**, **TABLE_WRITE**, **DBOBJ_CREATE**, **DBOBJ_DELETE**
8. **SCRIPT_EXEC**: execute script 
9. **TEST_EXEC**: execute testing script

Please note that all the databases and tables related to access privileges are created in the distributed file system (DFS).

### 1.4 Set Access Privileges

Only administrators can set access privileges and it must be done on the controller. Newly created users and groups do not have any access privilege. Administrators can use commands `grant`, `deny` and `revoke` to set access privileges. The 9 access privileges in [Section 1.3](#13-access-privilege-types) are used as values for the parameter "accessType" in these commands. If the first 5 access privileges are specified, the applied object "objs" must be specified.

We use 4 examples below to illustrate how to set access privileges. 

**Example 1**

Log in as "admin":

```
login(`admin, `123456)
```

Create user NickFoles with password AB123!@. Users can change their own password with command `changePwd`.

```
createUser("NickFoles","AB123!@")  
```

Grant the privilege to read any DFS table to user "NickFoles":

```
grant("NickFoles",TABLE_READ,"*") 
```

Deny user "NickFoles" the privilege to create or manage databases:

```
deny("NickFoles",DB_MANAGE)   
```

Create group "SBMVP", and add "NickFoles" to the group: 

```
createGroup("SBMVP","NickFoles")  
```

Grant the privilege to create tables in databases "dfs://db1" and "dfs://db2" to group "SBMVP":

```
grant("SBMVP",DBOBJ_CREATE,["dfs://db1","dfs://db2"])    
```

In the end, user "NickFoles" has the access privileges:

* Can read all tables.
* Cannot create or delete databases.
* Can create tables in databases "dfs://db1" and "dfs://db2".

**Example 2**

You can add users to a group to set the access privileges conveniently:

```
createUser("EliManning", "AB123!@")  
createUser("JoeFlacco","CD234@#")  
createUser("DeionSanders","EF345#$")  
createGroup("football", ["EliManning","JoeFlacco","DeionSanders"])  
grant("football", TABLE_READ, "dfs://TAQ/quotes")  
grant("DeionSanders", DB_MANAGE)  
```

The example creates 3 users "EliManning", "JoeFlacco", and "DeionSanders" and 1 group "football". All these users belong to the group. Grant the group the privilege to read table "dfs://TAQ/quotes", and grant user "DeionSanders" the privilege to create or delete databases.

**Example 3**

We can use command `grant` or `deny` to grant or deny certain privileges on all objects (\*). For example, to grant user JoeFlacco the privilege to read all DFS tables:

```
grant("JoeFlacco",TABLE_READ,"*")  
```

After we grant or deny privileges on all objects to a user or a group, we can only revoke the privilege on all objects. If we try to revoke the privilege on any specific object, the operation would not be effective:

```
revoke("JoeFlacco",TABLE_READ,"dfs://db1/t1")
```

The command above has no effect. 

```
revoke("JoeFlacco",TABLE_READ,"*")
```

The command above successfully revokes the privilege of JoeFlacco to read all DFS tables. 

Similarly, after we grant or deny certain privileges to a group, we can revoke the privilege from the group, but we cannot revoke the privilege from a group member.

**Example 4**

If a user possesses the **DB_OWNER** privilege, she can grant other users the privileges on the databases created by the user herself.

Create two users "CliffLee" and "MitchTrubisky", and grant  "MitchTrubisky" the privilege **DB_OWNER**.

```
createUser(`CliffLee, "GH456$%")
createUser(`MitchTrubisky, "JI3564^")
grant(`MitchTrubisky,DB_OWNER);
```

Log in as "MitchTrubisky". Create table "dfs://dbMT/dt" and grant "CliffLee" the privilege to read the table.

```
login(`MitchTrubisky, "JI3564^");
db = database("dfs://dbMT", VALUE, 1..10)
t=table(1..1000 as id, rand(100, 1000) as x)
dt = db.createTable(t, "dt").append!(t)
grant(`CliffLee, TABLE_READ, "dfs://dbMT/dt");
```

Although the user "CliffLee" did not have any permissions after being created, in the end, "CliffLee" is granted with the permission to access the data table "dfs://dbMT/dt" created by "MitchTrubisky".

### 1.5 Rules about Access Privileges

A user's access privileges are determined by her own access privileges and the privileges of the groups that she belongs to. Different groups may specify different access privileges to the same user. For these situations the following rules apply:

Please note that when discussing the rules below, for convenience, we can view a user as belonging to a special group with herself as the only member.

* If a user is granted a privilege in at least one group and is not denied this privilege in any other group, then the user has this privilege.
* If a user is denied a privilege in at least one group, then the user does not have this privilege, even though she may have been granted the privilege in other groups.

For the second situation, there are 2 ways for an administrator to grant the privilege to the user:

* Execute `grant` in all groups where the userâ€™s privilege is denied.
* `revoke` the denial in all groups where the userâ€™s privilege is denied:
  * the user then has the privilege if it has been granted in other groups;
  * if it has not been granted in other groups, the user can have this privilege after an administrator grants it to her.


The following example describes how the privileges are determined when a user's privileges conflict with that of a group to which she belongs:

```  
createUser("user1","123456")  
createUser("user2","123456")  
createGroup("group1")  
createGroup("group2")  
addGroupMember(["user1","user2"],"group1")
addGroupMember(["user1","user2"],"group2")
grant("user1",TABLE_READ,"*")  
deny("group1",TABLE_READ,"dfs://db1/t1")  
deny("group2",TABLE_READ,"dfs://db1/t2")
```

The result of the 3 lines above: user1 can read any table except "dfs://db1/t1" and "dfs://db1/t2".  

``` 
grant("user2",TABLE_WRITE,"*")  
deny("group1",TABLE_WRITE,"*")  
grant("group2",TABLE_WRITE,"dfs://db1/t2")  
```

The result is: user1 and user2 cannot write to any table.  

### 1.6 Function View

[Function view](https://www.dolphindb.com/help/DatabaseandDistributedComputing/DatabaseOperations/FunctionView.html) provides a flexible way to control user access to databases and tables. Only administrators can define or delete a function view. Users can get the result of a function view on a table when they don't have the privileges to read the table. 

For example, an administrator defines the function view "countTradeAll" and grants user "NickFoles" the privilege to execute the function view:

```
login(`admin, `123456)
def countTradeAll(){  
	return exec count(*) from loadTable("dfs://TAQ","Trades")  
}
addFunctionView(countTradeAll)  
grant("NickFoles",VIEW_EXEC,"countTradeAll")
```

Log in as "NickFoles", and execute function view `countTradeAll`

```
countTradeAll()
```

Although NickFoles cannot read table "dfs://TAQ/Trades", he can execute function view `countTradeAll` to get the number of rows in table "dfs://TAQ/Trades".

Function views can have parameters. In the following example, we create a function view to get the trades of a specified stock on a specified date:

```
def getTrades(s, d){
	return select * from loadTable("dfs://TAQ","Trades") where sym=s, date=d
}
addFunctionView(getTrades)
grant("NickFoles",VIEW_EXEC,"getTrades")
```

Log in as "NickFoles", and execute function view `getTrades` with specified stock symbol and dateï¼š

```
getTrades("IBM", 2018.07.09)
```

## 2. Access Control for Scheduled Jobs and Streaming

Scheduled jobs and streaming are jobs that run in the background. Whether these jobs can be executed depends on whether the users who created these jobs have the access privilege for these jobs.

### 2.1 Access Control for Scheduled Jobs

When a user schedules a job, she does not need to have access privileges on the objects that are involved. However, if the user does not have privileges to access the objects when the scheduled job is set to be executed, the scheduled job will not be executed.

```
login("NickFoles","AB123!@")  
def readTable(){  
	read_t1=loadTable("dfs://db1","t1")  
	return exec count(*) from read_t1  
}  
scheduleJob("readTableJob","read DFS table",readTable,minute(now()),date(now()),date(now())+1,'D');
```

In the example above, job `readTable` can be scheduled even if user NickFoles does not have privilege to read table "dfs://db1/t1". When the job is set to be executed, however, if "NickFoles" does not have privilege to read table "dfs://db1/t1", the job will not be executed. 

Administrators can delete all scheduled job with command `deleteScheduledJob`; a user can only delete scheduled jobs created by herself. 

#### 2.2 Access Control for Streaming

To write to a shared stream table on the publisher side, a user must have the **TABLE_READ** and **TABLE_WRITE** privileges.

When a user uses function `subscribeTable` to subscribe to a stream table, she should make sure that she has the **TABLE_READ** privilege to read the stream table. The user must have both **TABLE_READ** and **TABLE_WRITE** privileges to write to the local table where the subscribed data will be saved.

```
login("NickFoles","AB123!@")
def saveTradesToDFS(mutable dfsTrades, msg): dfsTrades.append!(select today() as date, * from msg)  
subscribeTable("NODE1", "trades_stream", "trades", 0, saveTradesToDFS{trades}, true, 1000, 1)
```

In the example above, the streaming handler `saveTradesToDFS` saves subscribed data to table dfsTrades. If "NickFoles" does not have privilege to write to table dfsTrades, then the streaming task will fail. 

## 3. Secure Communication with HTTPS

DolphinDB supports HTTPS for secure communication over the web. 

### 3.1 Enable HTTPS

There are 2 ways to enable HTTPS:

* Add "enableHTTPS=true" in the configuration file of the cluster controller (controller.cfg)

* Add `-enableHTTPS true` in the command line when starting the cluster controller. 

### 3.2 HTTPS Certificate

We need to install server authentication certificate at each server in DolphinDB for secure connections. There should be a certificate on the controller and each of the agent nodes. Data nodes use the certificate located at the agent node on the same server. 

#### 3.2.1 Certificate Authority (CA) Certificate

Get a certificate from a certificate authority, rename it as server.crt, and copy to the folder "keys" under the home directory of the controller. If the folder "keys" does not exist, we need to create it. The certificate does not need to be installed as it is from a certificate authority. This is recommended in most use cases. 

#### 3.2.2 Self-Signed Authentication Certificate

Sometimes we may want to install a self-signed authentication certificate. For example, in a small isolated cluster or in a research (non-production) setting. Please take the following steps:

(1) Set the configuration parameter *publicName* as the domain name of the computer

The following is an example of the command line in Linux to start the controller, where www.ABCD.com is the domain name of the server where the controller is located:

```
./dolphindb -enableHTTPS true -home master -publicName www.ABCD.com -mode controller -localSite 192.168.1.30:8500:rh8500 -logFile  ./log/master.log
```

(2) Check if the authentication certificate and private key have been generated 

Start the controller node and check if the certificate file *server.crt* and the private key for the server serverPrivate.key exist in the folder "keys" under the home directory. 

(3) Install the self-signed certificate to the certificate authority of the web browser

In Google Chrome, choose Settings -> Advanced -> Manage certificates -> AUTHORITIES-> Import to install the self-signed certificate server.crt. In other web browsers, there might be slight differences in this process. 

![](images/Selection_047.png)  

Now enter https://www.ABCD.com:8500/ in the web browser to connect to DolphinDB cluster manager, where 8500 is the port number of the controller. If you see a green lock sign and "Secure" in the address bar, the authentication certifiate has been successfully installed.

![](images/Selection_046.png)

## 4. SSO (Single Sign-On)

On the web-based cluster manager, we can click any data node to open a notebook on this node. The data node may be located on a different physical server from the controller node. DolphinDB provides SSO (Single Sign-On) so that users don't need to log in the system again when visiting different servers in a cluster.

DolphinDB provides 2 API functions for SSO:
+ `getAuthenticatedUserTicket()`: issue the current user's encrypted ticket
+ `authenticateByTicket(ticket)`: use the ticket generated by `getAuthenticatedUserTicket()` to log in the system. 

DolphinDB developers can use these API functions to develop more functionalities.
