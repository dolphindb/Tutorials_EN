## 1. System Requirements

Operating system: Linux (kernel 3.10 or above)

RAM: 2 GB or above

Flash memory: 8 GB or above

Supported ARM CPU: 

- CORTEXA15
- CORTEXA9
- ARMV7  
- ARMV8
- CORTEXA53  
- CORTEXA57  
- CORTEXA72  
- CORTEXA73

The cross compiler used in DolphinDB ARM is arm-linux-gnueabihf4.9 for 32-bit systems and aarch64-linux-gnu_4.9.3 for 64-bit systems. 

## 2. Download DolphinDB Database

Download DolphinDB for ARM from [DolphinDB](http://www.dolphindb.com/downloads.html) website and extract it to a directory. For example, extract it to the following directory:

```
/DolphinDB
```

## 3. Update License File 

If the user has obtained the Enterprise Edition license, please use it to replace the following file:

```
/DolphinDB/server/dolphindb.lic
```

## 4. Run DolphinDB Server

Go to folder /DolphinDB/server/ and run the executable file *dolphindb* 

Before running the executable, please change its access permissions:

```
chmod 777 dolphindb
```

Then modify configuration parameters in the file *dolphindb.cfg*:

The default port number is 8848. Set the port number with parameter *localSite* to 8900:

```
localSite=localhost:8900:local8900
```

Specify the maximum amount of memory allocated to DolphinDB with parameter *maxMemSize* (in terms of GB). To set it to 0.8 GBï¼š

```
maxMemSize=0.8 
```

Specify the maximum amount of memory allocated to an array with parameter *regularArrayMemoryLimit* (in terms of MB). It must be the exponential power of 2 with the default value of 2048. To set it to 64 MB:

```
regularArrayMemoryLimit=64
```

It's recommended to set the parameter *maxLogSize* based on your RAM size (in terms of MB). When the log file reaches this size it will be archived. The default value is 1024 MB and the minimum permissible value is 100 MB. To set it to 100MB:

```
maxLogSize=100
```

Run DolphinDB server:

- Linux console mode: 

```
./dolphindb
```

- Linux background mode: 

```
./startSingle.sh
```

<!--
In Linux, we recommend starting in the background mode with Linux command **nohup** (header) and **&** (tail). Even if the terminal is disconnected, DolphinDB will keep running. "-console" is set to 1 by default. To run in the background mode, please set it to 0 ("-console 0"). Otherwise, the system will quit after running for a while. 
-->

In console mode, you can execute DolphinDB code from the command line. Otherwise, you can execute scripts via a user interface such as GUI or VS Code Extension.


## 5. Connect to DolphinDB Server from Web

Go to your browser (currently supporting Chrome and Firefox) and enter localhost:8848 in the address bar to open DolphinDB notebook. If you have started DolphinDB server with another port number, change 8848 to the port number you have used. Please note that if there is no execution on the web for 10 minutes, the session will be automatically closed to release resources on the server. We recommend users to work on DolphinDB GUI where all sessions remain open until terminated by users. 

## 6. Run DolphinDB Script from Web

Run the following DolphinDB script in the editor window of DolphinDB notebook. The figure below shows the output. 

```
table(1..5 as id, 6..10 as v)
```

## 7. Update DolphinDB Server

<!--
For Linux users, you can execute upgrade.sh under the subdirectory clusterDemo to update the server. Or you can follow the steps:

-->

Please follow the steps to update the server:

1. Close the server.

2. Backup the metadata. The default directory to save the metadata for a standalone mode is:

   ```sh
   /DolphinDB/server/local8900/dfsMeta/
   ```
   ```sh
   /DolphinDB/server/local8900/storage/CHUNK_METADATA/
   ```

   You can execute the following command on Linux to back up the metadata:

   ```sh
   mkdir backup
   cp -r local8900/dfsMeta/ backup/dfsMeta
   cp -r local8900/storage/CHUNK_METADATA/ backup/CHUNK_METADATA
   ```
   
>  If the backup files are not in the above default directories, please check the directories specified by the configuration parameters *dfsMetaDir* and *chunkMetaDir*. If the configuration parameters are not modified but the configuration parameter *volumes* is specified, then you can find the CHUNK_METADATA under the *volumes* directory.

3. Download a new version of server package from [DolphinDB website](https://dolphindb.com). You can also download a 1.30.6 server using the following Linux command:

   ```sh
   wget https://www.dolphindb.cn/downloads/DolphinDB_Linux64_V1.30.6.zip
   ```

>  Note the file name changes with different version number.

4. Unzip the package. Execute the following Linux command to unzip the package to the directory v1.30.6:

   ```sh
   unzip DolphinDB_Linux64_V1.30.6.zip -d v1.30.6
   ```

5. Replace the files under the server directory except for config, data, log folders and dolphindb.cfg.

>  Note: Please do not overwrite the existing server folder. If you have customized the parameters in the file *dolphindb.cfg*,  added scripts to the init file *dolphindb.dos*, or updated the license *dolphindb.lic*, make sure not to overwrite those files. Otherwise, you will lose your changes.

6. Restart the server and GUI. Execute the following command to check the version information:

   ```sh
   version()
   ```
