### Possible problems
1. After starting a server, the system immediately exits. The error message in the log file is "The license has been expired". 
Cause: license expired
Solution: contact support@dolphindb.com and update the license file. 

2. After starting the nodes on the web-based cluster manager, the nodes are still shown as stopped. 
Cause: need to refresh nodes status. 
Solution: click on the "refresh" button. If the log file has error message  "Failed to bind the socket on XXXX" in the log file where XXXX is the port number of a data node to be started, this could mean that the port number is occupied by another application. If so, just close that application and try again. It could also mean the port is not yet released by the Linux kernel if you just closed the data node with this port number. For this case, just wait around 30 seconds and restart the nodes.

For any problem in using DolphinDB database, please first check the log file for more information. There is a log file on each of the data nodes and on the controller node. The default folder of the log file is the home directory. You can post your questions on www.stackoverflow.com or contact us at support@dolphindb.com.
